Other useful commands:
* `.`: The **working directory**
* `..`: The **parent** of the working directory
* `~`: The **home** directory.
* `-`: The **previous** working directory



## Editors and Shell Scripts
We will use vim for this class to write our programs. In future classes, we will look into other editors such as VScode.
Vim commands:
  - vim filename -- to start editing a file with vim
  - ESC :w -- write/save the file
  - ESC i -- insert before the character
  - ESC a -- insert after the character
  - ESC :q -- quit vim
  
Basic Bash Shell Script called **unix_commands.sh**:
```
#!/bin/bash

mkdir new_folder
cd new_folder
touch new_file.txt
ls
```

Running a Bash Script in terminal:
```
chmod 777 unix_commands.sh
./unix_commands.sh
```

## Writing Hello World
- Create the file hello.c: ```vim hello.c```
- Enter the file and edit the contents of the file:
  ```
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main()
  {
    printf("Hello, World\n");
    return 0;
   }
  ```
 - Save and exit the vim editor: ```ESC :wq```
 - Compile the program: ```gcc hello.c```
 - Run the program: ```./a.out```


## Github

### Setting up Gtihub
Download git from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
  - Create a github account.
  - Open terminal, and set your username: 
  ```
      git config --global user.name "John Doe"
      git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com 
  ```
  - Set up your ssh key:
    - [Generate a new key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key)
      - Run the following command and then press enter to store the file in the default location. 
      ```
      ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
      ```
    - [Add ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account)
      -  Run the following command to copy the key to your clipboard. Then paste this key into your account settings. 
      ```
      pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
      ```
### Creating a branch
```
git checkout -b helloBranch
```
Copy your hello.c file into the directory and add and commit it with the commands shown bellow. Git status helps you see what files have been added, committed or pushed to origin.
```
git add hello.c
git status
git commit -m "first commit"
git status
```
Now push your branch to github:
```
git push origin helloBranch
```

### Merge branch to main
- To merge the new branch (helloBranch) into main, click on "Create pull request"
- Now that the PR (pull request) is created, we can review the code and add comments.
- Click "Merge pull request" to merge helloBranch into main.
  
## Homework:
  - Go to the hw link (https://classroom.github.com/a/MGFbjjfd) and make a team
  - In your terminal, clone the repo: ```git clone <link>```
  - Answers the questions in the readme file
  - push the main branch to github: ```git push origin main```
  
### Homework Help:
If you are having difficulty setting up the terminal on your computer (difficulty downloading cygwin, using github, ...), feel free to use Replit. I have attached a screen recording of how you can set up Replit, as well as doing the first couple steps of the homework.

Here is a video on how to do the first couple steps of the assignment, and push your changes to github:
